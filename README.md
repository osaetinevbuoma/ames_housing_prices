# Ames Housing Prices #

This project attempts to build models that can detect housing prices using the 
[Ames Housing dataset](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf). This project is
made available by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
